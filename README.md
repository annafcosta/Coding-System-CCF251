# Digital Logic Systems

This repository contains two practical projects aimed at introducing fundamental concepts in digital logic systems. Both projects explore various aspects of digital logic, introducing simpler concepts like basic circuits and culminating in the implementation of systems using state machines.

### ðŸ”µ Combinational Circuits

For this first project, the implementation of code to describe hardware using the Verilog language was suggested. The goal is to develop a system that will encode a 4-bit value into a different value, but still equivalent in the number of bits, and finally display the encoded numbers on a 7-segment display. In addition to the main objective, other points were established for the development of the encoder system, including the assembly of logical expressions using the proposed truth table, developing them through Karnaugh Maps with the final aim of increasing the systemâ€™s efficiency.

### âšª Sequential Circuits

The second project suggests the implementation of code to describe hardware using the Verilog language. The goal is to develop a system analogous to the functioning of a lottery, which involves the sequential selection of 5 numbers between 0 and 9, while the lottery sequentially draws 5 numbers, also between 0 and 9. In general, when placing a bet in the lottery, itâ€™s possible to win one of the two available prizes, 1 and 2, according to the restrictions proposed in the documentation. In other words, the overall objective is to automate the identification of winning bets. Therefore, a state machine was created to receive the numbers from the bets, analyzing at the end of each bet whether itâ€™s a winner or not. This will determine which prize the player has won.
